                    <p class="dek">An unbelievably large amount of money is pumped into European club soccer every year. This goes towards many different facets of the sport, including TV broadcasting, commercialization, and the transfer market. Twice a season, the transfer market opens up, welcoming more than 1,000 different clubs to negotiate the signings of potential additions to their squad by offering a specific price. In recent years, the fees paid for some of these players have reached extreme and outrageous levels…Which begs the question: what factors contribute to these ridiculous price tags?</p>

                <div class="section col-md-6">
                    <p>In 2017, French club Paris Saint Germain acquired Brazilian attacker Neymar Jr. from Spanish giants Barcelona for <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2017/8/confirmed-neymar-becomes-most-expensive-footballer-in-transfer-history-484811"target="_blank">£198 million</a>. The season before the transfer was made, Neymar was one of the top players in the world, recording an outrageous <a href="https://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/neymar/leistungsdatendetails/spieler/68290/plus/0?saison=2016&verein=&liga=&wettbewerb=&pos=&trainer_id="target="_blank"> 20 goals and 26 assists in only 40 games</a> across all competitions. The transfer made him the most expensive player of all time, completely shattering the former record of <a href="https://www.goal.com/en-us/news/100-most-expensive-football-transfers-all-time/ikr3oojohla51fh9adq3qkwpu"target="_blank">£89.1 million</a> paid by English club Manchester United for French midfielder Paul Pogba.</p>
                    <p>Since Pogba’s move to England in 2016, there have already been seven players, excluding Neymar, who have eclipsed Pogba's price point. All of them have been attacking players from either Europe or South America. Six of the seven have played in one of Europe’s top 5 leagues (The English, Spanish, German, Italian, and French). Additionally, they are all under 30 and have prevalent social media followings. In today’s transfer market, European soccer is headed toward a trend of throwing bags upon bags of money toward players that fit certain criteria.</p>

                <h3>The Value of Scoring</h3>
                <p>Scoring is the most important trait to have in European soccer. According to the <a href="https://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/spieler-statistik/wertvollstespieler/marktwertetop"target="_blank">TransferMarkt database</a>, the top-30 players with the highest market value are split up across three positions. Only five of the total 30 play at a defensive position, while 11 play at a midfield position, and the remaining 14 play at attacking positions. Those on the list valued more tend to have a higher goals-per-game ratio.</p>
                <p>This is reflected perfectly, as the top two highest valued players in the 2021-22 season, averaged the most goals per game. 23-year-old French striker Kylian Mbappe and 21-year-old Norweigan striker Erling Haaland averaged 0.64 and 1 goal per game, respectively, across all competitions. Mbappe’s market value comes out to be around £144 million, while Haaland’s is £135 million. The gap between Haaland’s price point and third place is an astounding £45 million. On the other side of the spectrum, Achraf Hakimi and Alphonso Davies sit at No. 30 and 28 in the market value rankings. Hakimi, a Moroccan defensive player under contract at French club Paris Saint-Germain, averaged a measly 0.07 goals a game, while Davies went the entire 2021-22 season without scoring a single goal.</p>
                <p>Current Division III soccer player at Suffolk University, Caleb Pongratz, says that he is not surprised by this. He says that although the defense plays an extremely integral part in winning soccer games, the goals are what grabs attention.</p>
                <p>“Where I play, we prefer to create goals as well,” Pongratz said. “In the pros, players will be more expensive based on their goal contributions.”</p>

                <h3>The Role of Social Media</h3>
                <p>While goals mean wins and wins mean progression, purchasing a new player is not just to obtain success on the pitch. Although many European clubs can profit off a big name by drawing more ticket sales on match days, they can also help the team in many other ways. Drawing in a fan favorite or well-known superstar can help in merchandise sales and sponsorships, provided that the player has a big enough following.</p>
                <p>Neymar has the largest Instagram following of the top-30 players with the highest market value, boasting 173 million. He ranks ninth in highest market value. Following Neymar, Mbappe comes in second with 71.2 million. Mohammed Salah, an attacker for English club Liverpool, is third with 50.2 million. Mbappe ranks first in highest market value, and Salah ranks fourth. It is clear that those who attract a more significant social media following present multiple opportunities for clubs to win on and off the field, causing the players' total market values to rise.</p>
                <p>Pongratz believes it is a no-brainer for teams to sign players with big followings. To better illustrate his point, he references Portuguese icon Cristiano Ronaldo, a premier player in today’s game and Instagram’s most-followed account.</p>
                <p>“Cristiano has over 430 million followers,” Pongratz said. “So wherever he moves, he’s going to bring those hundreds of millions of fans with him.”</p>
                <p>In July of 2018, Ronaldo completed a transfer from Spanish club Real Madrid to Italian club Juventus. On the day of his signing, Juventus gained more than 400,000 followers on their main and English Twitter pages and more than 1.4 million on Instagram, and 400,000 on Facebook, according to <a href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/blog/espn-fc-united/68/post/3567577/how-cristiano-ronaldos-move-to-juventus-impacted-social-media-accounts"target="_blank">ESPN</a>.</p>

                    <h3>The Background Check</h3>
                    <p>The <a href="https://www.goal.com/en-us/news/which-are-the-worlds-richest-football-clubs-in-2021/psbb7gblbm6j1m5mc753tv1us"target="_blank">top-10 most valuable clubs</a> in European soccer are spread out across five countries — England, Spain, Italy, France, and Germany. When these clubs start looking for their next transfer targets, a player’s age, contributions, and prior experience come into play.</p>
                    <p>Pongratz says it is only logical that soccer clubs seek young players to help the team's current performances. He uses Real Madrid’s Vinicius Jr, an attacker with the third-highest market value, as an example.</p>
                    <p>“Vinicius is worth a pretty steep £90 million, right? But he is only 21-years-old,” Pongratz said. “He is scoring 20 odd goals this year with just as many assists, and he has not even reached his athletic peak.”</p>
                    <p>Pongratz acknowledges that clubs should occasionally search for a more proven, experienced player in case of a potential derailing of a young career. However, in the end, Pongratz says that the gamble on young talent is usually worth it.</p>
                    <p>“I would say it is a case of heads or tails because you can go with the experience option for cheaper and still get a decent output,” Pongratz said. “But the youth factor is so hard to overlook. By building up a player, a team could steadily increase that player's productivity for over a decade.”</p>
                    <p>In the case of Vinicius Jr. and other promising young players, it is also important to see whether or not they are ready for the big stage. Big clubs are looking to insert their newest signings straight into the action more often than not. If the player has already had significant experience playing at a top-level, it raises his stock significantly.</p>
                    <p>João Felix is a 22-year-old forward playing for Athletico Madrid, a club in Spain. Athletico had bought Felix when he was just a teenager for £133 million, making him the third-most-expensive player of all time.</p>
                    <p>“Athletico signed Felix from Benfica, one of the most well-known clubs in Portugal,” Pongratz said. “Because Benfica is a competitive European side known to develop good, young talent, that is why his price point was so high.”</p>

            <strong>Soccer</strong> is a team sport between two opposing sides, each with 11 players. There are 10 outfield players and one goalie. The aim is to put the ball past the goalie to score more goals and win the game. Soccer is usually played on a rectangular field of grass. The average professional soccer game is split into two 45-minute halves. Large competitions in soccer include the World Cup and the UEFA Champions League.
